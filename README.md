# Portfolio Site

## Instructions
In the initial commit to this project you have been provided with a template developer portfolio site. Your task is to build your own portfolio site to show off your development work. This template is meant to help guide you but you do not need to follow this format, the site you create should reflect your personality.

## Requirements
A good developer portfolio site should include the follow:

* Your name and a brief paragraph about you and your experience
* Links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and any other site that shows off your experience such a Dribble, CodePen, etc
* A link to your resume in PDF format
* Sections highlighting some of your projects

## Provided Files

**images/\*** - A folder of images used in the site

**styles/main.css** - The styles used in the site

**index.html** - The structure of the site

**reumse.pdf** - An example resume used in the site

## Exercise Submission
You should deploy this site to the internet. We will cover how to do this in Module 13.
